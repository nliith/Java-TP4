# Java-TP4
Coursework for Qiong Liu's Java course taken at CY Tech in the first semester of the 2024/25 academic year.

This is one of four TP ("travaux pratiques") given as homework during the course.

This was an individual assignment, not a group project.

The objective of this specific project was to install IntelliJ IDEA on my laptop, get familiar with first example, class, object and review class diagrams.

The instructions I followed to complete the assignment can be found on my professor's website: [(https://www.qiongliu.info/teaching/2024-fall-java)].
